\chapter{Experimental Setup}

So far we discussed general aspects of dc-SQUIDs and how their working principle allows for highly sensitive magnetic flux measurements. As already briefly seen in subsection \ref{subsec_para_res}, when it comes to practical SQUIDs many theoretical considerations regarding parameter optimization need to be reevaluated to account for usability in practical experiments. We begin this chapter with general concepts of a practical SQUID design and introduce a typical low-noise setup with a room temperature readout electronic. In this working group, SQUIDs are mainly developed for the readout of \textit{Metallic Magnetic Microcalorimeters (MMCs)} (see section \ref{sec_MMC}). We will see in the following how those SQUIDs need to be designed to optimize their coupling to these detectors. Furthermore, this chapter will cover various methods to reduce quality factors of parasitic resonances, such as adding shunt resistors or coupling to normal conducting gold layers.

\section{Practical dc-SQUIDs}\label{sec_practical_SQUID}

The SQUIDs developed in this working group are used as current sensors for the MMC readout by sending the detected signals from the \textit{pickup coil} of the MMC to the input coil of the SQUID. The requirement of the latter entails a parasitic capacitance resulting in numerous resonances, as discussed in subsection \ref{subsec_para_res}. To achieve high inductive coupling between input coil and SQUID loop, it is necessary to fabricate them closely on top of each other, only separated by a thin insulating layer. The coupling strength is given by the dimensionless parameter 

\gl{
k_{\rm is} = \frac{M_{\rm is}}{\sqrt{L_{\rm i}L_{\rm s}}} \ \ , 
}{} 

where $M_{\rm is}=\Delta\Phi_{\rm s}/\Delta I_{\rm i}$ is the mutual inductance, describing how much flux $\Delta\Phi_{\rm s}$ is generated in the SQUID loop for a current change $\Delta I_{\rm i}$ in the input coil. This allows us to define the so-called coupled energy sensitivity $\epsilon_{\rm c}(f)$ with respect to the input coil, which by using equation \ref{energy_sens} is given as

\gl{
\epsilon_{\rm c}(f) = \frac{\epsilon(f)}{k_{\rm is}^2} = \frac{L_{\rm i}S_{I\rm ,i}}{2} \ \ .
}{}

This expression refers to the apparent current noise $S_{I\rm ,i}=S_{\rm \Phi_s}/M_{\rm is}^2$, which is generated by the flux noise from the SQUID loop through the coupling $M_{\rm is}$. A strong coupling can be achieved by the commonly used square \textit{washer}-geometry with a planar input coil \cite{Jay1981}, as shown in figure \ref{abb:washer}.

A thin insulating layer separates the washer from the planar multi-turn input coil above. Left: View from the top. Right: Cross section marked by the dashed line.}
{washer}

Here, the SQUID loop is represented by the washer, whereas each turn of the input coil is symmetrically located on top of it to maximize the coupling between each system. A cross section of this setup is depicted in figure \ref{abb:washer} (right), showing the insulating dielectric layer separating each coil. The washer is intersected by a slit, which starts at the square hole in the middle and ends at the remotely situated junction area that connects each side of the loop. The total inductance of the SQUID loop can be calculated by adding the dominating washer hole inductance $L_{\rm h}$, the slit inductance $L_{\rm t}\approx \qty{0.3}{\pH\per\um}$ and the much smaller parasitic inductance $L_{\rm j}$ associated with the junction area, giving \cite{Ketchen1991}

\gl{
L_{\rm s} = L_{\rm h} + L_{\rm t} + L_{\rm j} \ \ .
}{}

The latter is referred to as parasitic due to it's position outside of the input coil, thus not contributing to the coupling. By neglecting $L_{\rm t}$ and $L_{\rm j}$, we can approximate the washer inductance in the limit of $d\ll w$ to $L_{\rm s}\approx L_{\rm h}\approx 1.25{\rm\mu_0}d$, where $d$ and $w$ are the inner and outer side lengths, respectively \cite{Ketchen1981}. This is a reasonable result considering that the supercurrent will only flow along the inner edge of the washer \cite{Ketchen1982}, thereby being independent of the outer side length $w$. The effective area $A_{\rm eff}$ of the SQUID loop has been calculated to $A_{\rm eff}\approx dw$ \cite{Ketchen1985}, showing that this geometry allows for high sensitivity while keeping the SQUID inductance small. The input coil inductance on the other hand can be approximated by $L_{\rm i}=L_{\rm str}+n^2L_{\rm s}$, where $L_{\rm str}$ is the stripline inductance (see section \ref{sec_damping}) and $n$ is the number of input coil turns \cite{Ketchen1981}. The dc-SQUID designs used in this working group, however, are too complex to provide such analytical expressions and therefore need to be calculated numerically using simulation softwares such as \textit{InductEX}. 

\subsection{Gradiometer}

{gradiometer}

The high flux sensitivity of a SQUID makes it prone to detect unwanted magnetic bias fields and/or gradients that may be present during its operation. Typical SQUIDs are therefore built in a gradiometric design to counteract this effect. A first order gradiometer consists of two identical conducting loops connected in series or parallel, with opposing orientation as shown in figure \ref{abb:gradiometer} (left, middle). Under the presence of a homogeneous bias field $\textbf{B}$ in x-direction, this configuration produces a zero net current after a field change $\Delta B_{\rm x}$, due to the opposing currents induced in each turn. To also achieve the same effect for a field gradient $\frac{\del \textbf{B}}{\del z}$, a second order gradiometer composed of four loops in series or parallel is required, see figure \ref{abb:gradiometer} (right) where only the currents induced in the upper loops are drawn for the sake of overview. In order to incorporate this into a practical SQUID, the input coil and the SQUID loop will consist of four serial and parallel turns, respectively. This configuration enables to combine a small SQUID inductance with a large input coil inductance while maintaining a strong coupling between the two, as each turn of both coils can be produced with similar dimensions. The low SQUID inductance results from the reciprocal summation over each loop inductance $L_{\rm w}$ due to the parallel connection, giving

\gl{
L_{\rm s} = \frac{L_{\rm w}}{4} \ \ .
}{}

Whereas a serial gradiometer gives 

\gl{
L_{\rm i} = 4L_{\rm w}
}{}

for the input coil. This gradiometric setup allows for adapting the input coil to the pickup coil of an MMC by choosing a large enough inductance $L_{\rm i}$, which will be discussed in section \ref{sec_SQUIDdesign}.
