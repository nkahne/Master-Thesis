\chapter{Experimental Setup}

So far we discussed general aspects of dc-SQUIDs and how their working principle allows for highly sensitive magnetic flux measurements. As already briefly seen in subsection \ref{subsec_para_res}, when it comes to practical SQUIDs many theoretical considerations regarding parameter optimization need to be reevaluated to account for usability in practical experiments. We begin this chapter with general concepts of a practical SQUID design and introduce a typical low-noise setup with a room temperature readout electronic. In this working group, SQUIDs are mainly developed for the readout of \textit{Metallic Magnetic Microcalorimeters (MMCs)} (see section \ref{sec_MMC}). We will see in the following how those SQUIDs need to be designed to optimize their coupling to these detectors. Furthermore, this chapter will cover various methods to reduce quality factors of parasitic resonances, such as adding shunt resistors or coupling to normal conducting gold layers.

\section{Practical dc-SQUIDs}\label{sec_practical_SQUID}

The SQUIDs developed in this working group are used as current sensors for the MMC readout by sending the detected signals from the \textit{pickup coil} of the MMC to the input coil of the SQUID. The requirement of the latter entails a parasitic capacitance resulting in numerous resonances, as discussed in subsection \ref{subsec_para_res}. To achieve high inductive coupling between input coil and SQUID loop, it is necessary to fabricate them closely on top of each other, only separated by a thin insulating layer. The coupling strength is given by the dimensionless parameter 

\gl{
k_{\rm is} = \frac{M_{\rm is}}{\sqrt{L_{\rm i}L_{\rm s}}} \ \ , 
}{} 

where $M_{\rm is}=\Delta\Phi_{\rm s}/\Delta I_{\rm i}$ is the mutual inductance, describing how much flux $\Delta\Phi_{\rm s}$ is generated in the SQUID loop for a current change $\Delta I_{\rm i}$ in the input coil. This allows us to define the so-called coupled energy sensitivity $\epsilon_{\rm c}(f)$ with respect to the input coil, which by using equation \ref{energy_sens} is given as

\gl{
\epsilon_{\rm c}(f) = \frac{\epsilon(f)}{k_{\rm is}^2} = \frac{L_{\rm i}S_{I\rm ,i}}{2} \ \ .
}{}

This expression refers to the apparent current noise $S_{I\rm ,i}=S_{\rm \Phi_s}/M_{\rm is}^2$, which is generated by the flux noise from the SQUID loop through the coupling $M_{\rm is}$. A strong coupling can be achieved by the commonly used \textit{Washer}-geometry with a planar input coil \cite, as shown in figure \ref{abb:washer}.
