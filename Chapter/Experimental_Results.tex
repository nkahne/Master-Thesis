\chapter{Experimental Results} \label{ch_results}

This chapter will provide an overview over the general performance of the first stage dc-SQUIDs developed within the framework of this thesis. Particularly, the overall resonance behavior and the noise spectra were investigated. We will begin with a summary of characteristic parameters obtained by our measurements and compare them with the target values. The SQUIDs were produced in the institute's cleanroom and then tested both in a single- and a two-stage setup as described in section \ref{sec_operation}. The single-stage measurement was carried out at $T=\qty{4.2}{\kelvin}$ in a liquid helium transport vessel as well as in a dilution cryostat with $T=\qty{10}{\milli\kelvin}$. The former submerges the SQUIDs in liquid helium via a dipstick, which provides a sample holder for PCBs. The SQUIDs are glued onto those PCBs and can be electrically connected to them through aluminum bond wires, by utilizing the bond pads shown around the border of the chip in figure \ref{abb:damped_chip}. The sample holder is equipped with both a superconducting (niobium) and a soft-magnetic shield to suppress external magnetic fields. The read-out is enabled by connecting the broadband SQUID electronic of the type XXF-1 (see subsection \ref{subsec_fll}) to the dipstick and using it to both supply the necessary bias and ramp current signals to the SQUID as well as provide the FLL feedback circuit. The SQUID electronic is then controlled via software and the voltage output observed on a keysight InfiniiVision\footnote{Keysight Technologies Deutschland GmbH, Herrenberger Straße 130, 71034 Böblingen} oscilloscope. The noise measurement has been conducted with the two-stage setup at $T=\qty{10}{\milli\kelvin}$ in the cryostat, whereas the single-stage measurements to obtain characteristic Front-End properties have been done both in the helium vessel and the cryostat. 

\section{Characteristic dc-SQUID Parameters}

Despite all above-mentioned distinctions between the Fron-End variants, most characteristic parameters such as the SQUID loop inductance $L_{\rm s}$ or shunt resistance $R_{\rm s}$ are unaffected by these variations. We therefore consider the following measurements to be representative for all variants and assume the errors to stem from fabrication-related deviations across the wafer. \\
To qualitatively explain the following considerations, we present the current-voltage as well as the voltage-flux characteristics of one of the measured SQUIDs, shown in figure \ref{abb:iv_vphi_result}. This SQUID with the label HDSQ17-W1-3C16 is of the type 'non-lossy' with inductive damping and has been measured at $T=\qty{10}{\milli\kelvin}$. We start the characterization by measuring the slope of the IV curves across the ohmic regime, which corresponds to the normal resistance $R_{\rm n}$ of the SQUID. Including the SQUID chosen for figure \ref{abb:damped_chip}, we measured 10 SQUIDs from the wafer HDSQ17-W1 covering all above-mentioned variants. The median normal resistance taken from these SQUIDs yielded the value $R_{\rm n}=\qty{3}{\ohm}$. This corresponds to a shunt resistance $R_{\rm s}=2R_{\rm n}$ of $R_{\rm s}=\qty{6}{\ohm}$, which exactly corresponds to the targeted value of $R_{\rm s}=\qty{6}{\ohm}$. The maximum voltage swing as seen in figure \ref{abb:iv_vphi_result} (right) is obtained by applying a bias current $I_{\rm b}^{\rm max}$ supplied by the SQUID electronic, giving median values of $\Delta V_{\rm max}=\qty{29.95}{\micro\volt}$ and $I_{\rm b}^{\rm max}=\qty{11.62}{\micro\ampere}$ for all 10 SQUIDs. For $T=\qty{0}{\kelvin}$, $I_{\rm b}^{\rm max}$ should correspond to twice the critical current $I_{\rm c}$ (compare figure \ref{abb:IV_VPhi_theo}). Due to the finite temperature we obtain noticeable thermal smoothening visible in the IVC of figure \ref{abb:iv_vphi_result} (left), such that the critical current is better approximated by \cite{Drung1996}

We therefore calculate the critical current to\footnote{Calculated with the median of all 10 Ic's. If I calculate Ic once with the median of Ib,max, then the result is Ib,max/2 $\approx$ 5.81. Which is better? For the above argument, 5.84 fits better.} $I_{\rm c}=\qty{5.84}{\micro\ampere}$. This corresponds to a critical current density of $j_{\rm c}=\qty{28.8}{\ampere\per\centi\meter\squared}$, such that both values only deviate \qty{2.7}{\percent} from the design values. The junction capacitance thus becomes slightly smaller than the design value according to the empirical relation introduced in section \ref{sec_FEdesign}. Using the fitted function $\frac{1}{C'}=0.132-0.053\log_{10}j_{\rm c}$ obtained in \cite{Bauer2022} and by again assuming $C'=C$, the capacitance yields $C=\qty{0.948}{\pico\farad}$, which is in excellent agreement with the target value of \qty{0.95}{\pico\farad}. The McCumber parameter can now be calculated to $\beta_{\rm C}=0.61$, also fitting well with the design value of 0.62. The screening parameter is typically derived by using the $\beta_{\rm L}$-dependent normalized current swing $\frac{\Delta I_{\rm max}}{2I_{\rm c}}$ at $V=0$, which has been numerically simulated in \cite{Tesche1977}. We estimated the current swing by extrapolating both extremal IV curves for the theoretical case of $T=0$, thus neglecting the thermal rounding and obtaining a minimal and maximal critical current. The current swing $\Delta I_{\rm max}$ therefore yields approximately ??, giving a screening parameter of ?? which fits well... The value for $\Delta I_{\rm max}$, which approximately corresponds to the current swing of the voltage-biased SQUID in a two-stage configuration, indicates that the SQUID is well adapted to the arrays produced in this working group \cite{Kempf2015}\footnote{Die arrays in diesem paper sind andere als die die wir nutzen und haben $M^{-1}=12.9$ µA/phi0. Wo finde ich veröffentlichungen zu HDSQ15w3 arrays?}. These arrays have a typical reciprocal mutual inductance of $\frac{1}{M_{\rm ix}}=\qty{11.7}{\micro\ampere\per\fq}$, such that the flux $\Delta\Phi_{\rm x}$ coupled to the array is $\Delta\Phi_{\rm x}=M_{\rm ix}\Delta I_{\rm max}=....$, which is close to the optimal value of $\frac{\unit{\fq}}{2}$ to achieve a flux gain of $G_{\rm \Phi}\approx 3$ (see section \ref{subsec_2stage_theo}). 
Hysteretic behavior related to $\beta_{\rm L}$ and $\beta_{\rm C}$ should therefore not occur and thus be absent in the IVCs. The intersections and current steps seen in figure \ref{abb:iv_vphi_result} stem from resonances, which will be discussed in section \ref{sec_resonance_results}. \\

From $\beta_{\rm L}$ we can determine the SQUID loop inductance, such that we get $L_{\rm s}=...$. This value is .... than the optimal design value of \qty{147}{\pico\henry}. A simulation with InductEX provided the value ...., which is ... . This deviation has been observed in previous works \cite{Ferring2015,Bauer2022}.
The mutual inductances of the input and feedback coil were obtained by both sending a bias current to the SQUID loop and a current ramp signal to the coils. Counting the obtained voltage oscillations per given current ramp amplitude leads to the measured values $M_{\rm is}=\qty{627}{\pico\farad}$\footnote{preliminary, but should roughly correspond to median} and $M_{\rm fs}=\qty{51}{\pico\farad}$. The latter coincides well with the measured value of \qty{50}{\pico\farad} from \cite{Bauer2022}. The input coil current sensitivity is almost twice as large as the value determined with the previous design with a single-turn input coil, which yielded $M_{\rm is}=\qty{328}{\pico\farad}$ \cite{Bauer2022}. This result can be understood by the general linear dependence of the mutual inductance from the number of turns \textit{n} of the input coil and the SQUID loop inductance, i.e. $M_{\rm is}\approx nL_{\rm s}$ \cite{Ketchen1981}. This expression would need to be multiplied by a factor of 4 due to the parallel connection of the four washer loops. The result doesn't match the measured lower value of the previous design for $n=1$, however, one needs to account for the parasitic inductance at the junction area that doesn't contribute to M, which in turn reduces the mutual inductance. The fact that $M_{\rm is}\approx 2\cdot \qty{328}{\pico\farad}>627$ can be explained by two reasons. On one hand, we made a conservative estimation for the geometric ajustment of the washer loop size, tendentially resulting in a slightly smaller inductance\footnote{reformulate after calculating Ls} $L_{\rm s}$. On the other hand, the two-turn input coil structure might deteriorate the coupling constant $k_{\rm is}$, as compared to a single turn. This parameter will be determined together with the input coil inductance in the following subsection \ref{subsec_Li}.

As for the transfer coefficients, we obtained different values for the positive and negative slopes of the $I\Phi$ curve. This is attributed to the intended assymetric current injection, which is realized by differing SQUID loop inductances between each arm of the loop, ultimately leading to a unilaterally larger transfer coefficient $I_{\rm \Phi}$ \cite{Ferring2015}. The values are $I_{\rm \Phi,+}=\qty{10.2}{\micro\ampere\per\fq}$ and $I_{\rm \Phi,-}=\qty{23.1}{\micro\ampere\per\fq}$ for the positive and negative slope, respectively. The voltage transfer coefficient is approximately symmetric and yielded $V_{\rm \Phi,+}=\qty{94.0}{\micro\volt\per\fq}$ and $V_{\rm \Phi,-}=\qty{93.0}{\micro\volt\per\fq}$. Except for $I_{\rm \Phi,+}$, the variance of these parameters was rather large with deviations from the median of up to \qty{39}{\percent}. These results are nevertheless comparable to previous SQUIDs produced in this working group.
