\chapter{Summary and Outlook}

In this work we introduced a new dc-SQUID design optimized for the readout of the MMC-based X-ray detector maXs100, which is developed in this working group. For this, the design based of the work of \cite{Bauer2022} was adapted by increasing the input coil inductance to match the inductance of the detector pickup coil. Contrary to the intermediary flux transformer approach tested in \cite{Bauer2022}, the inductance was adjusted by adding a second turn to the input coil. This measure maximized the flux-to-flux coupling $\Delta\Phi_{\rm s}/\Delta\Phi$, which is a crucial parameter to   


-Slightly increase Rs to obtain ideal betaC \\
-Same with Ls \\
-Try crosstype for even lower noise
