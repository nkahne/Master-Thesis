\chapter{dc-SQUID Design} \label{ch_SQUIDdesign}

The main objective for this thesis was the optimization of an existing front-end SQUID design for an improved coupling to the maXs100 detector developed in this working group. As we have seen in the previous section \ref{sec_MMC}, adjusting $L_{\rm i}$ to the detector coil ensures the maximization of the flux-to-flux coupling and, therefore, minimizes the extrinsic energy sensitivity. The parasitic inductance $L_{\rm par}$, that arises from the aluminum bonds between the SQUID and the detector, has been estimated to \qty{0.5}{\nano\henry} \cite{Hengstler2017}. The previous SQUID design exhibits a design value of $L_{\rm i}=1.64$ for the input coil inductance \cite{Bauer2022}, which, therefore, fulfills the condition $L_{\rm i}=L_{\rm p}+L_{\rm par}$ for the pickup coil inductance of the ECHo-100k detector of $L_{\rm p}=\qty{1.14}{\nano\henry}$ \cite{Mantegazzini2021}. Other MMCs from this working group such as the 4k-pixel molecule camera MOCCA and the X-ray detector maXs100 require higher input inductances, as their pickup coil inductances are $L_{\rm p}=\qty{8.8}{\nano\henry}$ and $L_{\rm p}=\qty{6.65}{\nano\henry}$, respectively. In \cite{Bauer2022} SQUIDs with matching input inductances for the MOCCA and maXs100 detector were developed for the first time using an intermediary coupling transformer. These improved the calculated energy resolution $\Delta E_{\rm FWHM}$ of the detectors, although the effect was minimal for the latter. Specifically for the maXs100 detector, a different approach was, therefore, followed in the framework of this thesis to achieve a better coupling while avoiding a significant increase of the detector noise.  

\section{dc-SQUID with a Two-Turn Input Coil} \label{sec_FEdesign}

Increasing the input coil inductance can be realized either by changing the geometry of the coil itself, or by implementing an intermediary flux transformer, with the benefit of easily adapting the inductance independently of the SQUID design. The latter, however, was accompanied with a reduction of the effective coupling constant $k_{\rm is}'$ in the work of \cite{Bauer2022} regarding the maXs100 detector readout, which led to a lower flux-to-flux coupling despite the higher input inductance $L_{\rm i}'=\qty{5.47}{\nano\henry}$. Only the white noise reduction of the SQUID, which was caused by the shielding effects of the added flux transformer, resulted in a calculated small overall improvement of $\epsilon_{\rm p}$ and $\Delta E_{\rm FWHM}$. \\
In this work we designed a new detector SQUID with \textit{window-type} Josephson junctions, which is based on the design developed in \cite{Bauer2022}. A drawing of this new SQUID is shown in figure \ref{abb:NL_FE}. Four large oval loops form the second order gradiometer described in subsection \ref{subsec_gradio}, where the lower niobium layer (Nb1) contains the SQUID loop as a parallel gradiometer. The feed line coming from the top connects to the input coil, which consists of four loops in series. It was fabricated in a second niobium layer (Nb2) on top of the SQUID loop, only separated by an insulating SiO$_{\rm 2}$ layer. This geometry allows to combine a small SQUID loop inductance $L_{\rm s}=L_{\rm l}/4$ with a large input inductance $L_{\rm i}=4L_{\rm l}$. Also in the Nb2 layer, the feedback coil is located below the input coil as another second order serial gradiometer with feed lines on the bottom left. This coil has a design inductance of $L_{\rm f}=\qty{336}{\pico\henry}$ with a line width of \qty{3}{\micro\meter}. Both coils exhibit the same geometry as the corresponding underlying washer strip to maximize the overlap and, therefore, the coupling. At the same time, the coupling between input and feedback coil is kept small to mitigate cross talk between the two coils. The feed lines of the SQUID loop at the bottom center lead to the junction area, which is shown in the close-up. The window-type junctions are realized by structuring window-shaped vias on top of the square junction area, which connects the junction with the niobium layer above. Both square-shaped Nb/Al-Al$\rm O_x$/Nb junctions are realized with the dimensions $\qtyproduct{4.5 x 4.5}{\micro\meter}$ and a targeted critical current of $I_{\rm c}=\qty{6}{\micro\ampere}$, leading to a critical current density of $j_{\rm c}=\qty{30}{\ampere\per\centi\meter\squared}$. Two AuPd junction shunt resistors $R_{\rm s}$ are located on the left and right side of the junction area, respectively. Both are attached to a large heat sink made of two gold layers, a thick galvanized layer on top of a sputtered, thin one. These so-called \textit{cooling fins} provide a better electron-phonon coupling thanks to their large volume, which reduces the electron temperature of the normal-conducting shunts and thus mitigates the corresponding thermal noise \cite{Mazibrada2024}. A third AuPd resistor $R_{\rm d}$ with the same dimensions as the shunt resistors is placed above the junction area and connected in parallel with the washer loop. This so-called \textit{washer shunt} provides damping properties to reduce quality factors of parasitic resonances, as will be discussed in section \ref{sec_damping}.

As opposed to the previous design, the input coil is realized with two turns instead of one. Neglecting the stripline inductance $L_{\rm str}$ (see section \ref{sec_resonance_results}), the input inductance becomes approximately proportional to the number of turns squared $n^2$ \cite{Ketchen1981,Jaycox1981}, giving an expected value of $L_{\rm i}^{\rm theo}\approx2^{2}\cdot \qty{1.64}{\nano\henry}\approx\qty{6.56}{\nano\henry}$. To implement the second turn a wider washer loop line width of $w_{\rm s}=\qty{10}{\micro\meter}$ was needed. The line width of the input coil $w_{\rm i}$ with two turns remained at $\qty{3}{\micro\meter}$, which would not have been possible to fabricate on top of the previous washer width of $w_{\rm s}=\qty{5}{\micro\meter}$ without sacrificing coupling strength. A general increase in $w_{\rm i}$, however, entails the risk of capturing noise inducing flux vortices. These form if the B-field pointing perpendicular to the SQUID plane exceeds a critical field given by \cite{Kuit2008} 

\gl{
B_{\rm v,crit} = 1.65\frac{\unit{\fq}}{w_{\rm s}^2}	\ \ .
}{}

At the earths surface, its magnetic field reaches a maximum amplitude of \qty{65}{\micro\tesla}, which would give a threshold width of $w_{\rm s}=\qty{7.2}{\micro\meter}$. The dilution refrigerators used to cool down both the SQUIDs and the detectors typically provide magnetic shielding, such that we consider a width of $w_{\rm s}=\qty{10}{\micro\meter}$ to have a still negligible impact on the flux noise attributed to flux vortices. As the input inductance was the only parameter necessary to adjust, we attempted to keep the other design parameters unaltered. The widened washer width would, therefore, need to be compensated with a larger washer hole circumference in order to maintain the same SQUID loop inductance. 
The necessary increase was estimated by modeling the rather complicated oval washer loop geometry as a ring-shaped structure whose inductance can be calculated with the relation $L={\rm \mu_0}R\left(\ln\left(\frac{8R}{a}\right)-2\right)$, where \textit{R} denotes the loop radius and \textit{a} the radius of the wire \cite{Dengler2016}. This resulted in an estimated increase of \qty{15}{\percent}, necessary to compensate for the widened washer loop.
For the sake of safety, the circumference was increased only by \qty{10}{\%} to prevent possible hysteretic behavior, that can occur if the SQUID loop inductance $L_{\rm s}$ and, therefore, the screening parameter $\beta_{\rm L}$ grows too large. 
In addition to these geometric adjustments, an extensive (sputter) deposition of the ${\rm SiO_2}$ layer in the area of the washer loops was also omitted, allowing the interior to remain free from the insulating layer. This prevents potential flux noise induced by unavoidable magnetic impurities as well as due to dangling bonds in the $\rm SiO_2$. The same method was applied to the smaller loop areas formed by the feedback coil. The absence of insulation within the loops is visualized by the green-colored areas in figure \ref{abb:NL_FE}.

The design values for $R_{\rm s}$ and $L_{\rm s}$ are chosen such that the extrinsic energy sensitivity given in equation \ref{extr_energy_sens} is minimized, which requires the maximization of the flux-to-flux coupling ($L_{\rm i}=L_{\rm p}+L_{\rm par}$) and the minimization of the intrinsic white noise of the SQUID. In \cite{Bauer2022} this numerical calculation was done with the constraints $\beta_{\rm C}\leq 0.7$ and $\beta_{\rm L}\leq 1$ to avoid hysteretic behavior, which led to the optimal parameters $\beta_{\rm C}=0.7$ and $\beta_{\rm L}=0.86$. Consequently, additional noise through voltage jumps caused by hysteretic IVCs as well as Nyquist noise from higher harmonics of the Josephson frequencies \cite{Clarke1996} have been neglected for this minimization, which was not the case for the derivation of equation \ref{voltagenoise_psd}. The intrinsic white noise of the SQUID used for the numerical calculation is, therefore, given by the adjused expression \cite{Knuutila1988}

\gl{
S_{\rm \Phi_s} = 2k_{\rm B}T\frac{L_{\rm s}^2}{R_{\rm s}}\left[(1-k_{\rm is}^2s_{\rm in})^2+\frac{\sqrt{2}(1+\beta_{\rm L})^2}{\beta_{\rm L}^2}\right] \ \ .	
}{intr_FEnoise_minimize}

To achieve the targeted critical current of $I_{\rm c}=\qty{6}{\micro\ampere}$ with the given junction dimension of $\qtyproduct{4.5 x 4.5}{\micro\meter}$, we aim for a critical current density of $j_{\rm c}=\qty{29.63}{\ampere\per\cm\squared}$. The current density can be used to calculate the junction capacitance \textit{C} by using the empirical relation $1/C'=p_1 + p_2\log_{10}j_{\rm c}$, where $p_{\rm 1}$ and $p_{\rm 2}$ are constant fit parameters \cite{Maezawa1995}. Here, the intrinsic capacitance $C'$ excludes any parasitic capacitances arising from the window-type fabrication technique. For simplicity reasons, we assume $C\approx C'$ and thus obtain $C=\qty{0.95}{\pico\farad}$. The optimal Stewart McCumber and screening parameter then provide the values $R_{\rm s}=\qty{6.3}{\ohm}$ and $L_{\rm s}=\qty{147}{\pico\henry}$, respectively. The designed shunt resistor in both the previous and the new design was rounded to \qty{6}{\ohm}, which results with Ohm's circuit law in a normal resistance of $R_{\rm n}=\qty{3}{\ohm}$ for the whole SQUID. This consequently corresponds to a slightly lower damping parameter of $\beta_{\rm C}=0.62$. The coupling constant was set to an upper limit of $k_{\rm is}=0.75$, which is typically the highest achievable value for the SQUIDs produced in this working group. Under the assumption of $k_{\rm is}$ being maximal and $L_{\rm i}=L_{\rm p}+L_{\rm par}=\qty{7.15}{\nano\henry}$ for the maXs100 detector read-out, the theoretically obtainable flux-to-flux coupling regarding a single pickup coil is $\Delta\Phi_{\rm s}/\Delta\Phi_{\rm p}=\qty{5.38}{\percent}$. As expected, this value succeeds the value obtained for the previous design with a single-turn input coil, which yielded $\Delta\Phi_{\rm s}/\Delta\Phi_{\rm p}=\qty{3.9}{\percent}$ \cite{Bauer2022}. Lastly, for the extrinsic energy sensitivity we would obtain with equation \ref{intr_FEnoise_minimize} $\epsilon_{\rm p}=\qty{0.53}{h}$, assuming a detector operation temperature of $T=\qty{20}{\milli\kelvin}$.   

\section{Damping Methods} \label{sec_damping}

As discussed in subsection \ref{subsec_para_res}, several SQUID parameters can be optimized to mitigate the influence of various resonances in the circuit. However, we would like to choose these parameters accordingly to the minimization of the extrinsic energy sensitivity as discussed in section \ref{sec_FEdesign}. This choice imposes substantial limitations on the extent to which modifications can be implemented. For instance, increasing the length of the input coil $l_{\rm i}$ would move the corresponding microstrip resonance given by equation \ref{stripline_res_general} away from the operation frequency, while on the other hand leading to a larger input inductance, thus impeding the maximization of the flux-to-flux coupling. Furthermore, even resonances far away from the operation frequency can prove problematic as thermally activated transitions between different states increase the noise level \cite{Sepp1987}. This motivates a more practical approach to suppress \textit{LC} resonances, which can be realized through damping with attenuators, such as the damping resistor $R_{\rm d}$ shown in the top of the junction area in figure \ref{abb:NL_FE}. These are typically connected in parallel to the resonant circuit, as this reduces the quality factor \textit{Q} of the corresponding \textit{LC} resonance given an appropriate dimensioning of the resistor. Consequently, the $L_{\rm s}C_{\rm p}$ and $L_{\rm s}C$ resonances, that arise due to the parasitic capacitance $C_{\rm p}$ and the junction capacitance \textit{C}, can be damped by this \textit{washer shunt} $R_{\rm d}$ \cite{Ono1997, Ryh1992}. Although the crossing of the IVCs caused by the $L_{\rm s}C$ resonance could not be fully eliminated in previous works of this group, they showed a significant smoothing of the curves as the accompanying step structures were reduced \cite{Bauer2018}. The current noise introduced through this resistor, on the other hand, deteriorates the energy sensitivity and thus limits the damping benefit. However, this effect is minimal for the condition $R_{\rm d}\approx R_{\rm s}$ with $\beta_{\rm L}=1$ \cite{Enpuku1986, Ryh1992}, which is why we choose $R_{\rm d}=\qty{6}{\ohm}$. The input circuit is shunted with an $R_{\rm x}C_{\rm x}$ attenuator to damp the $L_{\rm i}C_{\rm p}$ resonance, where the added capacitance $C_{\rm x}$ blocks low frequency current noise \cite{Sepp1987}. Both damping techniques to suppress $C_{\rm p}$-related resonances were proven to be effective for various SQUID designs \cite{Knuutila1987, Enpuku1986,Can1991,Bauer2018}. As for the $\lambda/2$ resonances, both the $R_{\rm d}$ and the $R_{\rm x}C_{\rm x}$ attenuator provide good damping as well \cite{Can1991}, since they terminate the microstrip lines and thus avoid impedance mismatches given a suitable dimensioning of the resistors (see section \ref{sec_resonance_results}). A schematic of the resulting circuit diagram of the coupled dc-SQUID with all damping components is depicted in figure \ref{abb:RxCx_circuit} (left). Shown on the right is the design of the $R_{\rm x}C_{\rm x}$ shunt, which has been adapted from \cite{Bauer2022}. The capacitance $C_{\rm x}=\qty{10}{\pico\farad}$ is divided into two parallelly connected square-shaped planar capacitors with capacitance $C_{\rm x}/2$, each. The top and bottom plate of each capacitor are fabricated in the Nb2 and Nb1 layer, respectively. The shunt $R_{\rm x}$ is split as well into two parallel AuPd resistors with a resistance of $2R_{\rm x}$ each. Optimal values for these components will be discussed in chapter \ref{ch_results}.

\subsection{Lossy Input Coil}\label{subsec_L_FE}

Although the above-mentioned damping methods should provide significant improvement regarding the resonance behavior, further suppression of additional resonances can be, depending on the SQUID design, favourable or even necessary. For this reason, we apply two additional damping techniques, which require resistive gold layers electrically or inductively coupled to the circuit. The former will be covered in the following, whereas the latter is explained in subsection \ref{subsec_ind_damp}. \\
Several approaches to reduce \textit{Q} values of $\lambda/2$ resonances associated with microstrip lines have been investigated in \cite{Boyd2022}. The experimental setup consists of two parallel meanders with each having a length of \qty{6.5}{\milli\metre} and an inductance of \qty{2}{\nH}. They are fabricated on top of each other with insulating $\rm SiO_2$ between them and in a direct-coupled MMC setup, where as opposed to the flux transformer setup in section \ref{sec_MMC}, the SQUID is directly coupled to the sensor.

{dc-SQUID design with a two-turn input coil realized as a lossy microstrip line. A gold layer is structured between the insulating $\rm SiO_2$ and an upper niobium layer and has been fabricated in a single step as a bilayer. The overlying niobium in the Nb2 layer connects all four input coil segments over their respective washer loop to prevent the vias to acquire a normal resistance.} 
{FE_L}
The upper meander thereby represents the SQUID loop, whereas the lower carries a magnetizing current of approximately \qty{100}{\milli\ampere}. This setup produced high \textit{Q} resonances at integer and half-integer wavelengths. Whereas placing an individual resistor in parallel to one meander only damped the half-integer modes, a more distributed damping scheme in the form of an insulated gold layer between both meanders provided strong damping of all microstrip resonances while maintaining a low detector noise level. The \textit{Q} values further reduced by structuring the Au layer with the same geometry as the microstrip lines and electrically connecting it to one of the meanders, thereby preventing large, normal-conducting loops that would induce additional Johnson noise. The attenuation $\alpha$ of the microstrip line was measured to further quantify the damping. Generally, $\alpha$ represents the real part of the complex wave propagation constant $\gamma=\alpha+j\beta=\sqrt{(R+j\omega L)(G+j\omega C)}$, where $\beta$ is the imaginary part and $j$ the complex number. The parameters \textit{R}, \textit{L}, \textit{G} and \textit{C} represent the series resistance, the inductance, the conductance and the capacitance of the transmission line, respectively \cite{Pozar2011}.
The attenuation constant $\alpha$ of this lossy microstrip line increases with frequency and thickness of the Au layer, while the noise stayed insensitive upon thickness changes. 

Within the scope of this thesis, such damping techniques were implemented and tested on the dc-SQUID described in section \ref{sec_FEdesign}. For this, we sputtered a gold layer between $\rm SiO_2$ and Nb2 with the same geometry as the input coil running above the SQUID loop. This gold layer was omitted around the vias between the washer loops to avoid additional normal resistances. Gold and niobium were structured together as a bilayer in the same microfabrication step by sputtering the upper niobium layer directly after the gold. A schematic of our front-end design with this lossy input coil, including an image obtained with an optical microscope, is shown in figure \ref{abb:FE_L}. Our front-end SQUIDs with this gold layer beneath the input coil will be referred to as 'lossy' for the upcoming discussions. 

\subsection{Inductive Damping} \label{subsec_ind_damp}

Together with the attempt of suppressing resonances through a lossy microstrip line, we introduce a second new damping technique denoted as inductive damping. This method is based on the principle of magnetic damping, where a change in magnetic flux creates eddy currents in a nearby conductor, which following Lenz's law induces a flux trying to compensate the initial one. The flux change is therefore damped by effectively transferring part of the magnetic energy to the kinetic energy of the induced current, which in the case of a normal conductor emits heat. This phenomenon also causes the reduction of the geometric inductance of the SQUID loop due to the shielding effect of the flux transformer (see subsection \ref{subsec_extr_sens_theo}). A strong indicator that this mechanism can be applied to SQUIDs shows the first mentioned experiment in \cite{Boyd2022}, where a square gold layer representing the MMC sensor was placed at a hight of \qty{300}{\nano\meter} above an isolated meander. This lead to a significant reduction of the high \textit{Q} values of the meander modes. The concept is now applied to the feed lines on our SQUID chip, where large gold pads have been placed across the SQUID washer and feedback coil feed lines, as shown in figure \ref{abb:damped_chip}. The sharp voltage spikes associated with high \textit{Q} resonances, that can be present within those lines would therefore be damped by partly converting their energy into heat in the normal conducting gold layer. The gold pads are fabricated in the same layers as the heat sinks for the shunt resistors and are consequently sputtered first before being electroplated. The latter step significantly increases their volume, which allows for larger and more effective eddy currents. Additionally, the generated heat is expected to better dissipate into the chip substrate as the electron-phonon coupling increases with volume. All feed lines are typically realized as microstrip lines, but for this case we adjusted them into a coplanar structure as there is no insulation layer after Nb2. Figure \ref{abb:damped_chip} shows the chip design consisting of four distinct Front-End variants, each provided with the inductive damping scheme. The first channel at the top is realized without an input coil in order to better allocate possible resonance structures visible in the SQUID's IVCs. The design introduced in \ref{sec_FEdesign}, also referred to as 'non-lossy', is represented in channel 2, followed by the lossy variant in channel 3. The last channel contains a lossy Front-End as well, however, the washer loop interiors were not kept $\rm SiO_2$-free. This allows to investigate the influence of possible magnetic impurities in the insulation material and assess whether it can be regarded as negligible or not. The same chip design has been produced with and without gold pads on the feed lines, resulting in 8 different Front-End SQUIDs that were developed and tested within the scope of this thesis. We present our results in the following chapter.
